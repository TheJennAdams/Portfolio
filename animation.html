        <p>I wanted to create this site to demonstrate some of the cool and fun animation effects I'm learning in CSS. I was struggling with some animations I was trying to apply in JavaScript and I was excited to come across <a href="https://youtu.be/UmzFk68Bwdk?si=VeGGo9GUL8w_e1vA">this video</a> showing how to do some really cool web animations with just a few lines of CSS. Thanks Kevin for the awesome tutorial!

            <img class="food-pics" src="images/grapes.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Fresh fruit, like grapes, are a wonderful source of vitamins and minerals. And if you aren't eating literal candy every day, fruit is sweet and satisfying.</p>  
        <h2>Note: Animations are disabled on this site for people who have that preference set on their computer. (Animations can make some people feel sick, and you can turn them off for people who don't want to see them.)</h2>              
        <div class="animated-pics">
            <img class="food-pics" src="images/blueberries.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Blueberries! Yum! So many benefits. Antioxidants, flavor... What's not to like? I love to throw a handful of frozen blueberries in my morning shake every day.</p>        
        <div class="animated-pics">
            <img class="food-pics" src="images/cheese.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Don't you wish you had THIS charcuterie board at your next party? Or, forget the party, I want to just curl up on the couch and watch a movie and eat this all myself! This spread would also set the mood perfectly for a romantic evening for two.</p>

        <p>I just grabbed all of these images off Pixabay, so I don't have recipes for any of them, but this greek salad looks pretty tasty. </p>        
        <div class="animated-pics">
