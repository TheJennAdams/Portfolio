        <p>The Hero image above is coded with some fun animation effects. Scroll back up if you didn't notice them. Then scroll down slowly and notice how the text faces out as you scroll down, and fades back in again as you scroll back up. Ethan at Code the Web wrote a very clear and helpful article on how to achieve this effect.</p>

        <p>I wanted to create this site to demonstrate some of the cool and fun animation effects I'm learning in CSS. I was struggling with some animations I was trying to apply in JavaScript and I was excited to come across a video showing how to do some really cool web animations with just a few lines of CSS. Thanks Kevin for the awesome tutorial!</p>

        <p>Fresh fruit, like grapes, are a wonderful source of vitamins and minerals. And if you aren't eating literal candy every day, fruit is sweet and satisfying.</p>

        <p>Blueberries! Yum! So many benefits. Antioxidants, flavor... What's not to like? I love to throw a handful of frozen blueberries in my morning shake every day.</p>

        <p>Don't you wish you had THIS charcuterie board at your next party? Or, forget the party, I want to just curl up on the couch and watch a movie and eat this all myself! This spread would also set the mood perfectly for a romantic evening for two.</p>
