                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <p>I've created several web pages now that highlight my skills as a front end developer and website designer. This page is one of them! I fell in love with the CSS Zen Garden project, and I wanted to base this website off of Number 208.</p>  
                <br>
                <div class="button">
                    <a href="https://csszengarden.com/208/" target="blank" class="btn">Shout Out to Site 208</a>
                </div>
                <br>                
                <p>I also built a résumé page. I had fun with the design on this one. It's not really finished per se but I'm happy with where it's at.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="button">
                    <a href="index.html" target="blank" class="btn">View My Résumé</a>
                </div>         
                <p>My proudest achievement to date - as far as web design and evelopment goes, at least - is my Artwork page. I built this page to display my art, talk about art, and hopefully at some point even sell some of my art.</p>
                <p>Make sure you view the page both in full screen and mobile view. There are some fun features you'll see in different ways depending on your screen size. I'm especially proud of my rotating flower, drop down menu, and the pièce de résistance: Previous and Next buttons!</p>
                <div class="button">

                <h2>UX/UI Design</h2>
                <p>I'm working through the Google Professional Certificate for UX/UI and following along with Figma tutorials so that I can build my own app: A reminder app that actually works! So many reminder apps have failed to be helpful in the ways I needed them to, that I'm taking things into my own hands and designing my own. </p>
                <br>
                <div class="button">
                    <a href="images/moodboard.png" target="blank" class="btn">Take a peek at my mood board!</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>My main goal with this app is to get a widget on your homescreen that will change throughout the day to get your attention and remind you to do things. It could be anything from a reminder to drink some water or brush your teeth, to remembering to call the doctor, pick up milk on the way home, or call your grandma and tell her you love her!</p>

                <p>I don't have it all mapped out yet, but I have a lot of ideas and plans for the future. I love what I'm doing and I can't wait to see where it leads me.</p>

                <p>I'm a little bit obsessed with favicons. They're just 16 x 16 pixels, but they make a huge difference! Click on the button below to see how beautiful the favicons I've created look on this Google homepage.</p>
