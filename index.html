                    <h4>Personal</h4>
                        <p>I'm a kickass 46-year-old single mom of 4 adult kids.  I got married way too young and had four kids and was a stay-at-home mom for many years. Now my children are all adults, but they're still all living at home and I help support them all. I love having them around though! I don't want any of them to leave. </p>

                    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                        <p>I love to paint, write, and design. I've painted murals throughout my house, I've doing oil painting, watercolor, and acrylic painting. I write poetry, short stories, non-fiction, and novels.</p>
